# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
The r squared value represents the accuracy of the linear regression model, with the value of this specific model is 0.626.
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?
136.5
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
I think that while the model CAN be an accurate predictor given the data, it does not and will not accurately predict each person's blood pressure, as each and every person has unique circumstances that could change their blood pressure, such as eating habits, macro-nutrient breakdown, etc.
