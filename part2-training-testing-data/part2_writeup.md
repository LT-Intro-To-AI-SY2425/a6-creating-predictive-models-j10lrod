# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
The model trains itself and performs tests that build the model off of previous runs to ensure greater accuracy as it continues to be used.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
The R squared value tells me the accuracy of my model, which says that this model is not 100% accurate.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
Though it's more accurate than the previous model, it is still not 100% accurate, with there being a significant margin for error in the y-values of the model.
